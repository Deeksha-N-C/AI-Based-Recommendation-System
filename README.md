INTERN ID: CT04DY1225

DOMAIN: JAVA PROGRAMMING

DURATION: 4 WEEKS

MENTOR: NEELA SANTOSH

DESCRIPTION:
The task was to develop a Java program that works with a CSV file containing product ratings.
The program asks the user to enter a product category (for example, Laptop, Tablet, or Smartwatch).
It then reads the CSV file, extracts the products that belong to the chosen category, and processes their ratings.
For each product in the category, the average rating is calculated.
Finally, the program outputs the highest-rated product along with the list of products and their average ratings.
Basic error handling was added to deal with cases like missing files or invalid input.

Tools and Technologies Used:
Programming Language: Java
Editor: Visual Studio Code (used to write, debug, and run the program).
CSV File: A simple text-based file storing product details like category, product name, and rating.
Java Utilities: Classes from the java.io package were used for file handling, and java.util classes such as Scanner, Map, and List were used for user input and data storage.

Environment Details:

Operating System: Windows (but the program is platform-independent since it is written in Java).
Editor: Visual Studio Code (with Java extensions for compiling and running code).

Project Structure:
The CSV file was placed inside the src folder for easy access.
The Java class (FileOperations.java) contained the logic to read data, process it, and display the results.

Applications of the Task:
E-commerce Systems: This type of program can be used to recommend the best products in a given category based on ratings.
Customer Insights: Businesses can use it to understand which product categories perform better.
Learning Purpose: The project demonstrates file handling, collection usage, and average calculation in Java.
Scalability: The concept can be extended to handle larger datasets or integrated with live product rating systems.
